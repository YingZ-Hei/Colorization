# Colorization

1. Introduction
Image colorization is a challenging task in computer vision, requiring models to predict realistic and appropriate colors for grayscale images. In this work, we investigate the generalizability of a deep learning-based colorization model across different image domains, including flowers, natural landscapes, and animated faces. Our approach uses CIELAB color space and CNN based on a pretrained ResNet-18 architecture to colorize images. We also explore the impact of different loss functions on colorization performance. Through experiments on three different applications, we analyze how model performance varies across image types and optimization objectives. Our results highlight the challenges of generalizing a single colorization model to diverse image applications.
